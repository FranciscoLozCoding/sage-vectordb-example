# End-to-End Sage Image Search: A Multimodal Hybrid Retrieval System for Scientific Image Collections

## Abstract

This paper presents Sage Image Search, a comprehensive multimodal hybrid retrieval system designed for scientific image collections. The system combines multimodal embeddings, advanced caption generation, vector search, keyword search, and intelligent reranking to enable both text and image-based queries across large-scale scientific datasets. Through systematic evaluation on the INQUIRE benchmark, we demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy, achieving up to 83.36% accuracy with 59.73% recall and 22.31% precision using our optimized architecture. The system leverages state-of-the-art models including DFN5B-CLIP-ViT-H-14-378, Gemma-3 language models, and Weaviate vector database in a scalable, containerized deployment.

## 1. Introduction

Scientific image retrieval poses unique challenges due to the specialized nature of scientific content, the need for precise semantic understanding, and the requirement to search across multiple modalities. Traditional image search systems often fail to capture the nuanced scientific context required for accurate retrieval in domains such as ecology, atmospheric science, and environmental monitoring.

The Sage Image Search system addresses these challenges through a novel end-to-end multimodal hybrid approach that integrates:
- Advanced multimodal embeddings for semantic understanding
- Sophisticated caption generation for enhanced searchability  
- Hybrid search combining vector similarity and keyword matching
- Intelligent reranking for improved relevance ordering
- Comprehensive evaluation framework using domain-specific benchmarks

This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of multimodal hybrid retrieval specifically optimized for scientific image collections, demonstrating substantial improvements over baseline approaches.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Overview

The Sage Image Search system implements a microservices architecture with the following core components:

1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline** (`weavloader`): Processes and indexes images with multimodal embeddings
2. **Multimodal Embedding Service** (`Triton Inference Server`): Serves multiple embedding models
3. **Caption Generation Service**: Generates detailed scientific captions using large vision-language models
4. **Vector Database** (`Weaviate v4`): Stores and indexes multimodal embeddings
5. **Query Processing Engine**: Handles hybrid search queries across multiple embedding spaces
6. **Reranking Service**: Refines search results based on query context
7. **Web Interface** (`Gradio`): Provides user-friendly search interface

### 2.2 Data Flow Architecture

```
[Scientific Images] → [Caption Generation] → [Multimodal Embedding] → [Vector Database]
                                                        ↓
[User Query] → [Query Embedding] → [Hybrid Search] → [Reranking] → [Results]
```

The system processes images through multiple parallel pipelines to create rich multimodal representations suitable for scientific retrieval tasks.

## 3. Multimodal Embedding Framework

### 3.1 Embedding Models

The system implements multiple embedding strategies to capture different aspects of visual and textual content:

#### 3.1.1 CLIP-based Embeddings

- **Performance**: Best overall performance in scientific image retrieval

#### 3.1.2 ImageBind Embeddings  
- **Model**: META ImageBind multi2vec integration
- **Modality**: Multi-modal (image, text, audio)
- **Use Case**: Baseline multimodal search
- **Integration**: Weaviate multi2vec-bind vectorizer

#### 3.1.3 ColBERT Text Embeddings
- **Model**: ColBERT v2.0
- **Purpose**: Token-level text embeddings for fine-grained caption matching

#### 3.1.4 ALIGN Embeddings
- **Model**: KakaoБrain ALIGN-base  
- **Training**: Large-scale noisy web data
- **Results**: Underperformed on scientific images due to domain mismatch

### 3.2 Embedding Fusion Strategy

The system implements weighted embedding fusion for multimodal queries:

```python
def fuse_embeddings(img_emb, txt_emb, alpha=0.5):
    combined = alpha * img_emb + (1.0 - alpha) * txt_emb
    return combined / np.linalg.norm(combined)
```

This approach allows dynamic balancing between visual and textual signals based on query characteristics.

## 4. Caption Generation Pipeline

## 5. Hybrid Search Implementation

### 5.1 Search Strategy

The hybrid search combines three complementary approaches:

#### 5.1.1 Vector Search

#### 5.1.3 Hybrid Fusion
```python
# Weaviate Hybrid Search Configuration
collection.query.hybrid(
    query=nearText,
    target_vector="clip",
    fusion_type=HybridFusion.RELATIVE_SCORE,
    alpha=0.7,  # Vector search weight
    query_properties=["caption", "camera", "host", "project"],
    vector=custom_embedding,
    rerank=Rerank(prop="caption", query=nearText)
)
```

### 5.2 Multi-Vector Search

The system implements multi-vector search across different embedding spaces:

The system employs a two-stage retrieval-reranking approach:

1. **Initial Retrieval**: Hybrid search returns top-K candidates (K=50)
2. **Reranking**: Cross-encoder model reorders results based on query-document relevance

#### 6.1.2 Reranker Model
- **Model**: cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2
- **Input**: Query-caption pairs
- **Output**: Relevance scores for final ranking
- **Integration**: Weaviate transformers-reranker module

### 6.2 Context-Aware Ranking

The reranker considers multiple contextual factors:
- Semantic similarity between query and caption
- Scientific terminology alignment
- Visual-textual consistency
- Domain-specific relevance signals
