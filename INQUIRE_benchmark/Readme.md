# INQUIRE Benchmark

This project uses the same setup as [Hybrid Search](../HybridSearch_example/) so that we can benchmark [Hybrid Search](../HybridSearch_example/) using [INQUIRE](https://github.com/inquire-benchmark/INQUIRE).

## Usage

This benchmark is supposed to be used in conjuction with [Hybrid Search](../HybridSearch_example/). The Makefile references components that are deployed in [Hybrid Search](../HybridSearch_example/). The Makefile in here deploys additional containers that are used to run the INQUIRE Benchmark.

## Running the Example

### Prerequisites
To run this example, you'll need:
- **Docker** installed on your machine with GPU access

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Spin up your Hybrid Search Instance**:
   - Navigate to the [Hybrid Search](../HybridSearch_example/) directory and follow those instructions to spin up a Hybrid Search Instance.

2. **Load in the dataset**:
   - Navigate back into this directory containing the `Makefile` file and run:
     ```bash
     make build && make load && docker logs inquire_weavloader -f
     ```
     >NOTE: This loads in [INQUIRE-Benchmark-small](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sagecontinuum/INQUIRE-Benchmark-small) into Weaviate.

3. **Calculate the Query Metrics**:
   - After dataset is fully loaded into Weaviate, run:
     ```bash
     make build && make calculate && docker logs inquire_benchmark -f
     ```
     >NOTE: inquire_weavloader's logs will indicate when the dataset is fully loaded into Weaviate.

4. **Retrieve the Results**:
   - After the metrics are calculated, run:
     ```bash
     make get
     ```
     >NOTE: This will copy the csv files into your currect working directory

### Results

Once the benchmark is ran, two csv files will be generated:
- `image_search_results.csv`
    - This file includes the metadata of all images returned by Weaviate when different queries were being ran.
- `query_eval_metrics.csv`
    - This file includes the calculated metrics based on images returned by different queries.

[evaluate.ipynb](./results/evaluate.ipynb) includes a more in depth look into `query_eval_metrics.csv`.
